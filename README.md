- 👋 Hi, I’m Bea
- 🎓 Software Engineering @ UCM in Madrid
- ☁️ AWS Cloud Practitioner | Ex-AWS Solutions Architect Intern

I am a software engineer focused on building scalable cloud-native systems. I have worked at AWS as a Solutions Architect Intern, where I contributed to the design and evaluation of AI-driven and cloud-native architectures, working with modern AWS services in real-world, large-scale environments. During my time there, I worked with the latest AWS services and frameworks for agentic AI, and delivered an AI multiagent solution.

I am currently working on my thesis, in which we're working on training computer vision neural networks for brain and brain lesion (ischemia) detection in MRI scans on mouse.

I enjoy taking systems from architecture and design through implementation and deployment, with and emphasis on reliability, scalability, and performance.
